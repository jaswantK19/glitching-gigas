## 📄 Document Ingestion

### Step 1: Ingesting Loan Recovery Documents

- **📚 Source of Knowledge**: The system is initially configured to ingest specific documents like `loan_recovery.txt`. These documents contain essential information related to debt recovery practices, processes, and legal frameworks.

- **✂️ Text Splitting**:
  - **Python Module Used**: `langchain.text_splitter`
  - **Chunking Strategy**: Text is split into chunks of around 500 characters with a 50-character overlap, preserving context across chunks for better query results.

## 🧠 Document Embedding and Vectorization

### Step 2: Embedding the Document for Fast Query Retrieval

- **🔢 Embedding Creation**: After the document is split, embeddings are generated for each chunk. These embeddings represent the document chunks as vectors, which can then be searched based on their relevance to a given query.

- **🤗 Embedding Model**:

  - **Python Module Used**: `langchain_huggingface.HuggingFaceEmbeddings`
  - We use HuggingFaceEmbeddings with a pre-trained model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to convert each text chunk into a high-dimensional vector, capturing the semantic meaning of the text.

- **🗄️ Vector Store Creation**:
  - **Vector Store**: FAISS (`langchain_community.vectorstores.FAISS`)
  - These embeddings are stored in FAISS, a fast and efficient vector similarity search library. This enables rapid retrieval of the most relevant chunks when a query is made.

## ❓ Question-Answering Chain

### Step 3: Building the QA Chain

- **🔍 Retrieving Relevant Chunks**:

  - **Python Module Used**: `langchain.chains.retrieval_qa`
  - **Search Strategy**: The system uses similarity search to find the best matches based on vector distance between the query and the document embeddings.

- **💡 Question Answering**:
  - **LLM**: Ollama LLM (llama3.2:1b)
  - **QA Chain Type**: Retrieval-based Question Answering with the LLM generating answers based on the retrieved chunks.

## 🎙️ Real-Time Speech Recognition

### Step 4: Speech-to-Text via Azure Cognitive Services

- **🗣️ Speech Recognition with Azure**:

  - **Python Module Used**: `azure.cognitiveservices.speech`
  - **Speech Recognition Process**:
    1. Agents speak into a microphone.
    2. The audio input is captured by Azure's SpeechRecognizer, which converts it into text using the `recognize_once_async()` method.

- **⚡ Code in Action**: When agents click "Use Microphone," the system listens to the spoken input, processes it using Azure's Speech API, and then forwards the transcribed text to the query retrieval system.

## 🔊 Real-Time Speech Synthesis

### Step 5: Text-to-Speech with Azure Cognitive Services

- **🗨️ Speech Synthesis**:

  - **Python Module Used**: `azure.cognitiveservices.speech`
  - **Speech Synthesis Process**:
    1. The system passes the response text to Azure's SpeechSynthesizer.
    2. The `speak_text_async()` method is used to convert the text into an audio stream, which is played to the agent.

- **🎬 Code in Action**: When agents click "Read Response Aloud," the system speaks the response to the agent using Azure's Text-to-Speech.

## 📈 Scalability and Adaptability

### Future Enhancements

1. **📚 Multi-Document Ingestion**: The architecture can be expanded to ingest and process multiple documents, such as collections manuals, compliance guides, and other training materials.

2. **🔄 Continuous Learning**: As new documents are ingested, the system continuously "learns" and expands its knowledge base.

3. **🎓 Voice-Enabled Coaching**: In future iterations, the system could provide real-time voice coaching during live interactions, giving agents feedback on collection strategies and guiding them through difficult conversations.

## 🚀 Key Technical Advantages

### Why This Architecture is Powerful

1. **⚡ Fast Retrieval**: Using FAISS for vector-based retrieval enables fast and efficient search across large documents, ensuring agents receive accurate answers in real-time.

2. **🧠 Advanced NLP Models**: The use of Ollama LLM allows the system to understand and generate responses for complex debt recovery scenarios, giving agents high-quality feedback.

3. **🎙️ Azure Speech Services**: Integration with Azure Speech Services enables seamless voice interaction, making it easier for agents to ask questions and receive spoken answers without leaving their workflow.

This document outlines the technical workflow and architecture of the AI-powered debt recovery training system, explaining how each component functions and works together to enhance agent training and performance. The system leverages cutting-edge NLP and Azure Cognitive Services to provide real-time answers and support to agents in the debt collection industry.
